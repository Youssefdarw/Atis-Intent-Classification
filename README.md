Content:
ATIS dataset provides large number of messages and their associated intents that can be used in training a classifier. Within a chatbot, intent refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment. While entity refers to the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue, the intent is what they really mean. For example, a user says, ‘I need new shoes.’ The intent behind the message is to browse the footwear on offer. Understanding the intent of the customer is key to implementing a successful chatbot experience for end-user.
